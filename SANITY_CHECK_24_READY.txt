# SANITY CHECK 24: READY ✓

**Implementation Status**: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

## What is FIX 15?

FIX 15 normalizes skill-up progression pacing for the 3-second tickrate by applying a 0.5x multiplier to all per-tick skill-up chances. This ensures skills level at an EverQuest-appropriate rate (~2x slower per real-time minute) rather than too fast.

## Implementation Details

### Constant
- **File**: js/defs.js (line 7)
- **Value**: `SKILL_UP_RATE_MULT = 0.5`
- **Status**: ✓ Defined and exported

### Weapon Skills
- **File**: js/weaponSkills.js (line 258)
- **Function**: tryWeaponSkillUp()
- **Application**: `if (Math.random() * 100 < chance * SKILL_UP_RATE_MULT)`
- **Status**: ✓ Implemented and tested

### Magic Skills
- **File**: js/magicSkills.js (line 642)
- **Function**: tryMagicSkillUp()
- **Application**: `if (Math.random() * 100 < chance * SKILL_UP_RATE_MULT)`
- **Status**: ✓ Implemented and tested

## Test Results

✓ **13/13 Tests Pass**

- Constant defined correctly (0.5)
- Weapon skill-ups use multiplier (Monte Carlo: ~1-3 per 100 attempts)
- Magic skill-ups use multiplier (Monte Carlo: ~1-3 per 100 attempts)
- Skills increase correctly when skill-up occurs
- Return types correct (boolean for weapon, object for magic)
- Caps respected (no skill-up at cap)
- Trivial targets gated (no skill-up vs low-level mobs)
- Multiple specializations independent (school and spec separate)

## Key Metrics

| Skill Value | Before | After | Factor |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| 10 | ~3% per tick | ~1.5% per tick | 0.5x |
| 50 | ~1.5% per tick | ~0.75% per tick | 0.5x |
| Real-time rate | 2x EQ speed | 1x EQ speed | 0.5x |

## Verification Checklist

✓ Constant in defs.js  
✓ Imported in weaponSkills.js  
✓ Imported in magicSkills.js  
✓ Applied in tryWeaponSkillUp()  
✓ Applied in tryMagicSkillUp()  
✓ Applied exactly once per RNG roll (no double-application)  
✓ Consistent formula across both systems  
✓ No syntax errors  
✓ All 13 tests pass  
✓ Monte Carlo verification shows correct reduction  
✓ Documentation complete  

## Acceptance Criteria - ALL MET ✓

✓ Weapon + magic skill progression normalized for 3-second tickrate  
✓ No double-application of the multiplier  
✓ All tests pass (13/13)  
✓ One global knob controls pacing  
✓ Backward compatible  

## Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION

FIX 15 has been verified to be:
- Complete (constant + both skill systems)
- Correct (proper formula, no double-application)
- Tested (13/13 tests pass)
- Documented (comprehensive specification and completion report)

Skill progression is now normalized for the 3-second tickrate environment.
